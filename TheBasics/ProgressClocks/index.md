# Progress Clocks

A **progress clock** is a circle divided into segments. Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble.

> Sneaking into the bandit camp? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

The **effect level** of an action or circumstance is used to tick segments on a clock (see **Effect Levels**). **It's the GM's job to tick a clock so it reflects the fictional situation.** If the PCs are making a lot of progress, the clock should be ticked a lot. This comes with practice, by properly judging effect levels. But you should always feel free to adjust a clock in play to better reflect the situation.

You can't usually fill a clock with the effect of a single action. This is by design. If a situation is simple enough for one action, don't make a clock, just judge the outcome based on the effect level of the action.

When you create a clock, make it about the **obstacle**, not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be "Interior Patrols" and "The Tower", not "Sneak Past the Guards" or "Climb the Tower". The patrols and the tower are the obstacles. The PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.

Complex enemy threats can be broken into several "layers", each with its own progress clock. For example, the Sarameian governor's villa might have a "Perimeter Security" clock, an "Interior Guards" clock, and a "Governor's Office Security" clock. The party would have to make their way through all three layers to reach the governor’s personal safe and the magical items within.

Remember that a clock tracks progress. It reflects the fictional situation, so the group can gauge how they're doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car. It *shows* the speed of the vehicle. It doesn't determine the speed.

### Simple Obstacles
Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time. Otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.

Examples of progress clocks follow. This is not an exhaustive list. Use them as you see fit!

### Danger Clocks
The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition. The guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc. (See **Consequences**.)

### Racing Clocks
Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The evil wizard pulling the strings of a tribe of kobolds might have a progress clock called "Escape" while the PCs have a clock called "Cornered". If the wizard finishes their clock before the PCs fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they're cornered and can't flee. If both complete at the same time, the wizards escapes to their lair, but the hunting PCs are outside!

You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the "Search" clock to find the lockbox on the sinking ship before the GM fills the "Sunk" clock and the vessel goes down.

### Linked Clocks
You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it's filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called "Trapped" after an "Alert" clock fills up. When you fight a veteran warrior, they might have a clock for their "Defense" and then a linked clock for "Vulnerable". Once you overcome the "Defense" clock, then you can attempt to overcome the "Vulnerable" clock and defeat them. You might affect the "Defense" clock with violence in a knife-fight, or you lower their defense with deception if you have the opportunity. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.

### Mission Clocks
The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes, e.g. the target escapes, the household wakes up for the day, etc.

### Tug-of-War Clocks
You can make a clock that can be filled and emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a "Revolution!" clock that indicates when the slum-dwellers of Bednik start to riot over poor treatment in Piotrgrad. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the revolution begins. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing turf war between two factions.

### Long-Term Project
Some projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like tinkering up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new designer drug) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and final completion. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project.

A long-term project is a good catch-all for dealing with any unusual player goal, including things that circumvent or change elements of the mechanics or the setting. For example, by default in the game, **trauma** is permanent. However, maybe a player wants to work on a project where they lock away traumatic memories and rehabilitate themselves by visiting a powerful psychic, reducing a character’s **trauma** but perhaps losing some cherished memories in the process. It will be a long and dangerous process to set up everything needed to begin and work on a project like this, but almost anything can be attempted as long as the group is interested and it seems feasible to everyone.

### Faction Clocks
Each faction has a long-term goal (see the faction write-ups). When the PCs have **downtime**, the GM ticks forward the faction clocks that they're interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they're not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the city and creating new opportunities and challenges.

The PCs may also directly affect NPC faction clocks, based on the missions and scores they pull off. Discuss known faction projects that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not.

## Progress Clocks In Play
> ***Infiltrating Haus Sternental***
> <br>
> *The adventurers are sneaking into Lord Morgenstern's house to steal a book in which he keeps secret maps of trade routes across the frozen equator (worth a small fortune to the right buyer). The GM makes a progress clock for the alert level of Morgenstern’s personal staff and bodyguards. They make a 4-clock because it’s a single house, not a sprawling estate. Only a few suspicious events will rouse the whole place. During the operation, Caio rolls to **Skulk** through the first floor and rolls a 4/5. He gets past, but the complication is a tick on the "Alert" clock. The GM ticks it once to represent the threat level of the kitchen staff downstairs. They’re not trained security, so limited effect is called for. Later, when Ling rolls a 1-3 on a desperate action to sneak into Morgenstern’s private suite, the GM fills three segments. The Lord’s bodyguards are Tier IV professionals and are experts at spotting trouble. This fills the clock! When Ling eases the door open, she’s set upon by the first pair of bodyguards, while the other two escort Morgenstern (and his precious book!) out the back way.*

> **Assaulting the Morrigan**
> <br>
> *The adventurers attack the fortress of the Morrigan, in a final showdown to see which group will survive to control the flow of trade in the Ice Cap Peaks. The GM makes a clock for the forces of each faction. As the PCs take actions and suffer consequences, the GM ticks the clocks to show the waning strength and morale of each side. When one side's clock is filled, they've reached a breaking point. Will they flee, surrender, or fall into a suicidal rage?*
