# Stress & Trauma

## Stress
Player characters in *Heroes in the Storm* have a special reserve of fortitude and luck called **stress**. When they suffer a consequence that they don't want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

> During a goblin ambush, Matt's character, Valaith, gets stabbed in the gut. Matt rolls his **Prowess** rating to resist, and gets a **2**. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Matt marks off 4 stress and describes how Valaith survives.
> 
> The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Valaith suffers level 2 harm (“Gut Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Organ Damage”).

## Pushing Yourself
You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):
* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you’re incapacitated.

The ability to push yourself for +1d means you effectively have at least 1d in every action as long as you have stress to burn. Even 1d gives you a 50/50 chance of success. This is the core "hero's luck" in the game system. Even when you’re in a bad spot, trying to do something for which you have no experience or training, you can dig deep and give yourself a chance. *(A much better chance than rolling 2d and taking the lowest when you have zero dots.)*

It’s important to remember this! Some players tend to forget and dismiss actions for which they have zero dots. "Nah, I can’t do that. I don’t have Attune. I’d have to roll 2d and take the worst. Ugh."" As long as you have stress to burn, you can get 1d and give any action a decent shot.

## Trauma
When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of **trauma**. When you take **trauma**, circle one of your trauma conditions like *Cold*, *Reckless*, *Unstable*, etc.

When you suffer **trauma**, you're taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero stress** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime (see **Vice**).

**Trauma conditions are permanent.** Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring adventurer. You must retire them to a different life, see **Stash & Retirement**.

### Trauma Conditions
* **Cold:** You're not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
* **Haunted:** You're often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
* **Obsessed:** You're enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
* **Paranoid:** You imagine danger everywhere; you can't trust others.
* **Reckless:** You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
* **Soft:** You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
* **Unstable:** Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
* **Vicious:** You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.

You can play your trauma conditions as much or as little as you like. They can totally transform your character’s persona or have only a small impact. It’s up to you. If you do play them strongly, though, allowing a trauma condition to complicate your character’s life, you earn **xp** for it, see **Advancement**.
