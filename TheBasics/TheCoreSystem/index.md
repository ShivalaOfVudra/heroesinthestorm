# The Core System

## The Conversation
A roleplaying game is a conversation between the GM and the players, punctuated by dice rolls to inject uncertainty and surprising turns.

The GM presents the fictional situation in which the player characters find themselves. The players determine the actions of their characters in response to the situation. The GM and the players together judge how the game systems are engaged. The outcomes of the mechanics then change the situation, leading into a new phase of the conversation (new situations, new actions, new judgments, new rolls) creating an ongoing fiction and building "the story" of the game, organically, from a series of discrete moments.

**No one is in charge of the story.** The story is what happens as a result of the situation presented by the GM, the actions the characters take, the outcomes of the mechanics, and the consequences that result. The story emerges from the unpredictable collision of all of these elements. You **play to find out** what the story will be.

## Judgement Calls
Since roleplaying is a collaborative, expressive act, not a purely strategic endeavor, you'll need to make judgment calls. By making these choices, the game group together establishes a style, tone, and form of fiction unique to their instance of play. *Heroes in the Storm* is designed to bring these judgment calls to the forefront and make them explicit tools of the game.

When you play, you'll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:

* Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? *Can this person be swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed?* The players have the final say.
* How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? *How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot?* The GM has the final say.
* Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? *Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the orcs merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?* The GM has the final say.
* Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? *Is your adventurer in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?* The GM has the final say.
* Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and party advancement? *Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us.* The players have the final say. 

The particular choices you make will create your own unique form of *Heroes in the Storm*. You'll say something about the world, the characters and life in general. What will you say? There’s only one way to find out.

## Rolling The Dice
*Heroes in the Storm* uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the **single highest result**.

* If the highest die is a **6**, it’s a **full success**; things go well. If you roll more than one **6**, it’s a **critical success** and you gain some additional advantage.
* If the highest die is a **4 or 5**, that’s a **partial success**. You do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
* If the highest die is **1-3**, it’s a **bad outcome**. Things go poorly. You probably don't achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.

*If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a **critical** when you have zero dice.*

All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you're first learning the game, you can always "collapse" back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.

The most common result is **4/5**: partial success. This means that your character will tend to succeed, but at a cost. You'll rarely get away clean. *Heroes in the Storm* is a game about underdog characters who are in over their heads. The dice mechanic reinforces this by making partial success crop up again and again. This is a good thing! Trouble is where the fun of the game happens.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you'll use a **trait** (like your **Skulk** or your **Prowess** or your party’s Tier) and take dice equal to its **rating**. You'll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game; a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you'll use are the **action ratings** of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their **Skirmish** action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.

There are four types of rolls that you'll use most often in the game:
* **Action Roll.** When a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.
* **Downtime Roll.** When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.
* **Fortune Roll.** The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. *How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much evidence is burned before the Bluecoats kick in the door?*
* **Resistance Roll.** A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. *When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a “Sprained Ankle” instead.*

## The Game Structure
*Heroes in the Storm* has a structure to play, with four parts. By default, the game is in **free play**. Characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed.

When the group is ready, they choose a *target* for their next quest, then choose a type of *plan* to employ. This triggers the *engagement* roll (which establishes the situation as the quest starts) and then the game shifts into the **quest phase**.

During the **quest**, the PCs engage the target. They make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the quest (successfully or not). When the quest is finished, the game shifts into the **downtime phase**.

During **downtime**, the GM engages the systems for *payoff*, *trouble*, and *entanglements*, to determine all the fallout from the quest. Then the PCs each get their *downtime activities*, such as indulging their vice to remove stress or working on a long-term project. When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to **free play** and the cycle starts over again.

Each phase works towards a different goal. For example, free play is very fluid. You can easily skim past several events in a quick montage and characters often split up to do things on their own or work their own personal projects. The quest phase is more concrete and focused. Play becomes about finishing the quest, and watching as the party overcomes each successive obstacle and challenge. The players use flashbacks to elide time and establish previously unseen preparations. After they finish the quest, play shifts into downtime and the focus of play moves to the consequences of the characters’ actions and resulting changes in the world.

The phases are a conceptual model to help you organise the game. They're not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options. Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.
