# Coin & Stash

## Coin
**Coin** is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets. The major nations of Adrianus mint coins of platinum, gold, silver and copper. One platinum piece is valuable enough to cover a major transaction. "Flashing a coin" is considered an ostentatious display of wealth. Most ordinary folk use small silver pieces for currency.

The few silver pieces the PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If an adventurer wants to toss a few silver around to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC's **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll (see **Stash**).

### Monetary Values
* **1 Coin:** A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.
* **2 Coin:** A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* **4 Coin:** A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.
* **6 Coin:** An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* **8 Coin:** A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* **10 coin:** Liquidating a significant asset, e.g. a carriage and mules, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 4 **coin** is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A party can also store 4 **coin** in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to 8 and then 16 **coin**. Any **coin** beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next quest) or distributed among the party members.

One unit of **coin** in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

### Coin Use

* Spend 1 **coin** to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 **coin** to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend **coin** to avoid certain party **entanglements**.
* Put **coin** in your character’s **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire.
* Spend **coin** when you advance your party’s **Tier**.

## Stash & Retirement
When you mark your character’s final **trauma** and they retire, the amount of **coin** they've managed to stash away determines their fate. Your **stash** tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0-10: Poor soul.** You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11-20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21-39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 **coin**) indicates the **quality level of the adventurer’s lifestyle**, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

> *Petros Pantelis is a rogue who cares a great deal about his sartorial swagger, and Rick, his player, often describes Petros as modeling the most stylish and outrageous fashion to impress his peers. But he’s just some street rat, right? How impressively is he really dressed? The GM can call for a **fortune roll** using Petros’s lifestyle level as the dice pool to find out how much impact the attire has.*

> *Shiva wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but she can’t take them back to where she's hiding out, so what to do? Kai, Shiva’s player, says she wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Shiva’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Shiva can manage.*

### Removing Coin From Your Stash
If you want to pull coin out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 coin in cash.**
