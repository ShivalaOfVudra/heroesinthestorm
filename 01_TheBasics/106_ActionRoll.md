# Action Roll

When a player character does something challenging, we make an action roll to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there's an obstacle to the PC's goal that's dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don't make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we'd expect them to simply accomplish, then we don't make an action roll.

> *Each game group will have their own ideas about what "challenging" means. This is good! It’s something that establishes the tone and style of your **Heroes in the Storm** series.*

To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity.

1. The player states their **goal** for the action.
2. The player chooses the **action rating**.
3. The GM sets the **position** for the roll.
4. The GM sets the **effect level** for the action.
5. Add **bonus dice**.
6. **The player rolls the dice** and we judge the result.

### 1. The Player States Their Goal
Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Maybe your goal is "I want to get into the manor house" or it might be "I want to see who comes and goes at the house". In both cases, the obstacle is "the house guard patrol". The guards are the challenging obstacle that may be dangerous or troublesome for the PC.

Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM's job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary.

> *"You're punching him in the face, right? Okay... what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?"*

### 2. The Player Chooses The Action Rating
The player chooses which **action rating** to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your **Skirmish** action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your **Command** action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.

There’s definitely some gray area here, where actions overlap and goals can be attempted with a variety of approaches. This is by design. If your goal is to hurt someone with violence, you might **Skirmish** or **Hunt** or **Skulk** or **Wreck**, depending on the situation at hand. If your goal is to dismay and frighten an enemy, you might **Command** or **Sway** or **Wreck**. It’s the player’s choice.

### 3. The GM Sets The Position
Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the **position** for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.

| Position | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Controlled | You have a golden opportunity. You're exploiting a dominant advantage. You're set up for success. |
| Risky | You go head to head. You're acting under duress. You're taking a chance. |
| Desperate | You're in serious trouble. You're overreaching your capabilities. You're attempting a dangerous maneuver. |

**By default, an action roll is risky.** You wouldn't be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.

Choosing the position is an important judgment call and stylistic choice for your game. More controlled action rolls mean generally safer and more dominant adventurers. More desperate action rolls give the game a gritty, underdog kind of feel. There’s no ironclad rule about how to choose positions. It’s meant to be an expressive element of the game. Make the choice that feels right to you and the rest of the group. If you're ever unsure about which position to pick, ask the other players.

As a player, if you're angling for a particular position, ask the GM what you might do to get it, or ask them to clarify the situation to explain their choice.

> *"It’s risky? I was thinking that it'd be controlled. I know that this barkeep is supposed to be a tough old buzzard, but he’s not a real threat to me, is he?"*
> <br><br>
> *“No, I think that the danger is in the situation instead. You're out in the common room in front of everyone, ordering the barkeep to hand over the reward money that he’s supposed to pay the Trio Infernale. Who knows if someone in the room might decide to step up and play hero, or to get on the Trio's good side? It's an uncertain environment. Maybe if you confront the guy alone, that’s more of a controlled position for you. Or maybe if you bring the party with you and make a show of force in front of everyone."*

As GM, you have final say over the position for the roll, but explain and clarify things as needed, especially when you’re starting out. By discussing the position (and how it might be better or worse) you’ll help everyone build a better view of the fictional situation in their minds’ eye and get on the same page about the tone of the game.

You'll also set precedents that the players can build on to make better decisions in the future.

> *"Ah, so we got a controlled **Consort** roll when we wined and dined them and showed them how friendly we are. Noted."*

### 4. The GM Sets The Effect Level
The GM assesses the likely effect level of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us "how much" this action can accomplish: will it have limited, standard, or great effect? Effect level is explained in detail in the next section.

> *The GM's choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player's choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by **Wrecking** something, well... maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn't be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like **Consorting** would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn't mean all actions should be equally risky or potent.*

### 5. Add Bonus Dice
You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).

For one bonus die, you can get **assistance** from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d. See **Teamwork**.

For another bonus die, you can either **push yourself** (take 2 stress) or you can accept a **Devil’s Bargain** (you can't get dice for both, it’s one or the other).

#### The Devil's Bargain
PCs in **Heroes in the Storm** are heedless adventurers who often shoot first and ask questions later. They don't always act in their own best interests. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Devil's Bargain. Common Devil's Bargains are:

* Collateral damage, unintended harm.
* Sacrifice **coin** or an item.
* Betray a friend or loved one.
* Offend or anger a faction.
* Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.
* Add **trouble** to the party from evidence or witnesses.
* Suffer harm.

The Devil’s Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die. There might not be an interesting Devil’s Bargain in every situation. If one doesn't occur to anyone right away, that’s fine.

> *"These mercenaries aren't the most trustworthy scum, so if we leave them alone with the coin, there's a good chance they'll bolt with it while we're gone. I'm gonna get all up in their faces and **Command** them to keep their dirty hands off."*
> 
> *"Oooh, I have a Devil’s Bargain. You can take +1d but they don't take well to threats. I'll start a new 4-clock called ‘Merc Revenge' and tick it three times. Push them around again you're going to have a second group to fight."*
> 
> *"Nice. I like it! Maybe I’ll try to un-tick some of that clock in downtime..."*

Some players like to get a little fancy or creative with Devil's Bargains, using them to re-write a bit of the situation, create something new in the flow of the narrative, or shine a spotlight on a character’s weaknesses.

> *"Someone here is a member of your old platoon. The one you left for dead."*
> 
> *"One of the cultists becomes obsessed with you."*
>
> *"The crates you're stealing have clear Guild markings. Your Guild friend is going to be miffed when she hears!"*

Don’t push these bargains too hard if the player doesn't like this kind of narrative sleight-of-hand. It’s fun for some and annoying for others.

The Devil’s Bargain is always a free choice. If you don't like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.

If it's ever needed, the GM has final say over which Devil’s Bargains are valid.

### 6. Roll The Dice And Judge The Result
Once the goal, action rating, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome. (See the sets of possible outcomes, by position, on the next page.)

The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a **6**), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a **4/5**), or it might just all go wrong (on a **1-3**).

On a **1-3**, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC's action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a **1-3** result.

> *Vark **Channels** a connection to an infernal entity that he found in the ruins of an ancient temple. The roll is a **1-3**. The GM could say that Vark fails to channel the infernal power, and the backlash from the desperate failure manifests as psychic harm, level 3. But it would be much more interesting if the channelling happened, and Vark was confronted with this horrific entity, mind-to-mind, right? Vark touches the horrible will of that ancient creature, and the twisting madness within it overwhelms him. He suffers level 3 psychic harm, sure, but also gets a new 6-clock: "Get Rid of These Nightmare Infernal Visions".*

Each **4/5** and **1-3** outcome lists suggested **consequences** for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by **resisting** them.

When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. *Tell us how you vault across to the other rooftop. Tell us what you say to the Janissary to convince them. When you face the Sarameian duelist, what’s your fighting style like? The GM will tell you the results of your actions.

## Double-Duty Rolls
Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a *6*, the PC wins and has their effect. On a **4/5**, it’s a mix. Both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a **1-3**, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.

## Action Roll Summary

* A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an **action roll** when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.
* The player chooses the **action rating** to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.
* The GM establishes the **position** and **effect level** of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.
* Add up to two bonus dice. 1) **Assistance** from a teammate. 2) **Push yourself** (take 2 stress) or accept a **Devil’s Bargain**.
* Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.

> * **1d** for each **Action** rating dot.
> * **+1d** if you have **Assistance**.
> * **+1d** if you **Push** yourself -or- you accept a **Devil's Bargain**.

| Result | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Critical | You do it with **increased effect**. |
| 6 | You do it. |
| 4/5 | You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or else do it with a minor consequence: a minor **complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**, you suffer **lesser harm**, you end up in a **risky** position. |
| 1-3 | You falter. Press on by seizing a **risky** opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach. |

| Result | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Critical | You do it with **increased effect**. |
| 6 | You do it. |
| 4/5 | You do it, but there’s a consequence: you suffer **harm**, a **complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**, you end up in a **desperate** position. |
| 1-3 | Things go badly. You suffer **harm**, a **complication** occurs, you end up in a **desperate** position, you **lose this opportunity**. |

### Desperate

| Result | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Critical | You do it with **increased effect**. |
| 6 | You do it. |
| 4/5 | You do it, but there’s a consequence: you suffer **severe harm**, a **serious complication** occurs, you have **reduced effect**. |
| 1-3 | It’s the worst outcome. You suffer **severe harm**, a **serious complication** occurs, you **lose this opportunity** for action. |
