# Actions & Attributes

## Action Ratings
There are 12 **actions** in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles:
* Channel
* Command
* Consort
* Hunt
* Skirmish
* Skulk
* Study
* Survey
* Sway
* Tinker
* Traverse
* Wreck

Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Qualitatively, each rating can be understood as the following level of competence:

| Action Rating | Competence |
|:-------------:|:----------:|
| 0 | Novice |
| 1 | Apprentice |
| 2 | Adept |
| 3 | Expert |
| 4 | Master |

Action ratings don't just represent skill or training. You're free to describe *how* your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at **Command** because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you'll make an **action roll** to see how it turns out.

### Coming From *Dungeons & Dragons*
If you're coming to *Heroes in the Storm* having previously played a d20 system such *Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition*, then you might find the following statistical equivalencies helpful:

| Action Rating | d20 Bonus |
|:-------------:|:---------:|
| 0 | +0 |
| 1 | +1 |
| 2 | +4 |
| 3 | +6 |
| 4 | +10 |

## Action Roll
You make an **action roll** when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character's **position**. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. If you're in a **controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you're in a **desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you're somewhere in between, it’s **risky**, which is usually considered the "default" position for
most actions.

If there's no danger or trouble at hand, you don't make an action roll. You might make a **fortune** roll, or a **downtime** roll, or the GM will simply say yes and you accomplish your goal.

## Attribute Ratings
There are three attributes in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: **Insight**, **Prowess**,
and **Resolve**. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the first column under that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.

## Resistance Roll
Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your **Prowess** rating. Resistance rolls always succeed. You diminish or deflect the bad result. However, the better your roll, the less **stress** it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.

When the enemy has a big advantage, you'll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you duel the master swordfighter, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your blade if you want to attack her.

The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.
