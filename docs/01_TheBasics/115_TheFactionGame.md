# The Faction Game

*Since the Return, Arden has experienced waves of chaos and disorder. Various factions have arisen to compete for influence in local, regional, and national spheres of power.*

## Tier
Each notable faction is ranked by **Tier** — a measure of wealth, influence and scale. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the world. Your party begins at Tier 0.

You'll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your party’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the **quality level** of your items as well as the quality and **scale** of the units your party employs and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.

#### Unit Scale By Tier

| Tier | Unit Size |
|-----:|----------:|
| V | Massive (80 People) |
| IV | Huge (40 People) |
| III | Large (20 People) |
| II | Medium (12 People) |
| I | Small (3-6 People) |
| 0 | Tiny (1-2 People) |

A given unit might have no units, one unit, or many units.

## Development
To move up the ladder and develop your party, you need **reputation**. **Reputation** is a measure of clout and renown. When you accrue enough rep, the other factions take you more seriously and you attract the support needed to develop and grow.

When you complete a quest, your party earns 2 **reputation**. If the target of the quest is higher Tier than your party, you get **+1 reputation per Tier higher**. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get **-1 reputation per Tier lower** (minimum zero).

**Reputation** is a kind of abstract currency. Losing reputation can be a consequence paid for actions that negatively affect the credibility of your party, or to limit the reputational harm that might occur due to events in the fiction.

Additionally, reputation is used to increase your Tier. You need **24 reputation** to fill the reputation tracker on your party sheet. When you fill the tracker, you can pay to increase your party Tier by one. This costs coin equal to your **new Tier × 8**. Once you pay the cost to increase your Tier, **subtract 24 from your reputation**.

## Faction Status
Your party's **status** with each faction indicates how well you are liked or hated. Status is rated from -3 to +3, with zero (neutral) being the default starting status.

When you create your party, you assign some positive and negative status ratings to reflect recent history. The ratings will then change over time based on your actions in play.

### Faction Status Changes
When you complete a quest, you gain -1 or -2 status with factions that are hurt by your actions. You may also gain +1 status with a faction that your quest helps. (If you keep your quest completely quiet then your status doesn't change.) Your status may also change if you do a favour for a faction or if you refuse one of their demands.

### Faction Status Levels
* **+3: Allies.** This faction will help you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same for them.
* **+2: Friendly.** This faction will help you if it doesn't create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same.
* **+1: Helpful.** This faction will help you if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.
* **0: Neutral**
* **-1: Interfering.** This faction will look for opportunities to cause trouble for you (or to profit from your misfortune) as long as it doesn't cause them problems or significant cost. They expect the same from you.
* **-2: Hostile.** This faction will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn't create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you.
* **-3: War.** This faction will go out of its way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you. When you're at war with any number of factions, your party suffers +1 **trouble** from quests and PCs get only one downtime action rather than two. You can end a war by eliminating your enemy or by negotiating a mutual agreement to establish a new status rating.

### Faction Status With Temples
Each of the major gods in Arden has temples throughout the land. Each of these networks of temples is a faction (if the temple is not identified as a separate faction in the standard list, you can still interact with it, since every god has a network of temples and functions as its own faction).

If you have good status with a temple, your party also has a good status with that god, which can provide supernatural aid when the party embarks on quests or other endeavours (if the god is displeased, you will lose status with the temple also). See the section on **Praying for Divine Favour** for more information.
