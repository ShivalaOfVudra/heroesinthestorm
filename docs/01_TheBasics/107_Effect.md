# Effect

In *Heroes in the Storm*, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand; great, standard, or limited? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a progress clock.

| Effect | Description | Ticks |
|:--------------|:------------|:-----:|
| Great | You achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest? What additional benefit do you enjoy? | 3 |
| Standard | You achieve what we’d expect as “normal” with this action. Is that enough, or is there more left to do? | 2 |
| Limited | You achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished? What effort remains to achieve your goal? | 1 |

## Assessing Factors
To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: **potency**, **scale**, and **quality**. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.

### Potency
The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. Holy power is potent against the undead. The supernatural powers of a ghost are potent against a human. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.

### Quality/Tier
Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarised by Tier. **Fine items** count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.

> *Jex is picking the lock to a Mabinogi safehouse. His party is Tier I and he has **fine** lockpicks, so he’s effectively Tier II. The Mabinogi are Tier III. Jex is outclassed in quality, so his effect will be **limited** on the lock.*

### Scale
Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.

When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in **zero effect**, or increased beyond great, resulting in an **extreme effect**.

If a PC special ability gives “+1 effect,” it comes into play *after* the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Warrior’s **Bodyguard** ability would bump them up to limited effect.

Also, remember that a PC can **push themselves** (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action.

For a master table of factor examples, see **Magnitude**. Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don't have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call, but don’t feel beholden to them.

## Dominant Factors
If one effect factor overshadows the others, the side with that advantage dominates the situation. It doesn't matter if you have a fine sword and extra effect if you try to fight 20 people at once. Their scale dominates the battle and you're left with very limited effect, or no effect at all. The same principle applies to “impossible” actions.

> *Shiva wants to tear down a stone guard tower that the her quarry is using as a lair. She says, “I take my sledgehammer over there and I Wreck the thing, smashing it down stone by stone. Ha! I rolled a crit! Great effect!” Obviously, this isn’t possible. A person can’t smash down a stone tower with a sledgehammer. We know it’s inherently silly, like jumping over the moon. But this is also codified in the effect factors. The tower is dominant in quality, scale, and potency. Unless those factors are countered somehow, Shiva’s effect level is zero before she starts. No matter what she rolls for her action, she’ll have no effect. This concept is useful when assessing other very tough (but achievable) situations.*
> 
> *Let’s imagine instead that Shiva is facing a demon. She wants to **Skirmish** with it, by engaging it with her sword and dagger. This is similar to knocking down the tower with the sledgehammer. Even on a **critical**, the GM says, “You manage to land a solid blow against the creature’s skull, but there’s no wound and your hand throbs with the impact of steel against its scaly hide.” In other words, zero effect! (On a **1-3**, the GM might say, “The creature swats your sword aside, clutches you in its hideous grip, and breaks your spine in two.” Seriously. Don't mess with demons.)*
> 
> *But this situation isn't entirely hopeless. There must be some way to battle a demon. This is where effect factors can help make sense of the situation. If the demon is dominant in quality, scale, and potency, then the PCs can try to understand the factors, and take actions to address them. What’s the demon vulnerable to? They can use that to remove its potency (and seize that advantage for themselves). What scale is it? They need to bring more troops. Etc.*
>
> *Effect factors are a way to codify the situation into a few key factors so it’s easier to talk about what needs to change in order to have the desired effect.*

## Trading Position For Effect
After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they're going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.

This kind of trade-off isn't included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation.

> *“I Skulk across the courtyard and vault over the wall, hiding in the shadows by the canal dock and Lyssa’s gondola.”*
> 
> *“I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the courtyard is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you'll have to Skulk through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.”*
>
> *“I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?”*
> 
> *“Yep, sounds good to me!”*

## Effects In The Fiction
Effects aren’t simply a matter of a level name or ticking clock segments. After the action roll, when you narrate the outcome, answer the effect questions by describing what happens "on screen". The answers to the questions will tell the group what the new situation is like, creating a natural bridge to further actions.

For a simple action, the effect level determines the end result. Do you achieve your goal partially, fully, or with great effect? For a more complex obstacle, the GM creates a progress clock to track the effort made to overcome it. You tick a number of segments on the clock depending on the effect level of your action and the factors involved. When you fill the clock, the obstacle is overcome. See Progress Clocks.

> *For example, if the player says “I shove him and run away,” that might be a simple action. It will have limited, standard, or great effect on the enemy, resulting in a new situation. The enemy might be slowed down (limited), knocked off their feet and delayed in the chase (standard), or even injured by a powerful throw (great), depending on the assessment of the factors at hand.*
>
> *If the player says, “I engage this guy in a knife fight to the death,” that might be a more complex obstacle. The GM creates a clock for the thug’s level of threat, then there are several action rolls to resolve the fight, each ticking the clock according to the effect level (and risking consequences from the outcome of each).*

Go with your gut and use simple or complex obstacles as you like, moment to moment in play. There’s no hard and fast rule for what’s “simple” or “complex.”

## Why We Do This
The reason we assess effect is to set expectations and make the fictional situation more clear, so everyone is on the same page.

> *You tangle with Francesc's enforcer, blade to blade. Do you inflict a grievous mortal wound? Do you only give them a shallow cut? Why are you having the effect that you have? How could it be worse? How could it be better?*

By assessing effect and describing it in the fiction, the players understand how much progress they’re making and how much they’re risking. By understanding effect, the group understands how many actions (and risk of consequences) will be needed to achieve their goals. Maybe a shallow cut is all you need to prove your point. Maybe nothing short of death will suffice. After each instance of action, effect, and consequences, the players know where they stand, and can make informed decisions about what to do next.

If you’ve played other roleplaying games or video games, you’re probably familiar with the concept of “hit points” for a character or a progress bar during a boss fight. The effect system in Blades is this type of pacing mechanic, abstracted so it can apply to any type of situation, from fighting, to social manipulation, investigations, arcane powers, infiltration, whatever! Every action has an explicit effect that everyone playing the game can understand, either resolving the current situation so we can move on to the next one, or incrementing progress toward the current goal.

## Consequences
When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it’s called a consequence. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.
