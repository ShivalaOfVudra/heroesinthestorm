# Overview

## The Game
Heroes in the Storm is a game powered by **Blades in the Dark** about a party of brave heroes venturing into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory in a world of fantastic adventure. There's magic and gods, angels and demons, bloody skirmishes, deceptions, betrayals, victories, and deaths.

We play to find out if the adventuring party can thrive amidst the teeming threats of bandit gangs, warring noble families, dangerous monsters, strange mages, ruins of lost civilisations and each party member's own foibles and vices.

## The Setting
The game takes place in the distant world of **Arden**. It's **late medieval** in its development. Imagine a world like ours during the 15th century, at the dawn of the Renaissance. There are horse-drawn carriages, sailing ships, primitive gunpowder technology and the printing press has just been invented, but has yet to take the world by storm.

Arden is also a **fantasy** populated by dragons, dwarves, elves, giants, gnomes, goblins, halflings, orcs and many other exotic and magical peoples. The poles of the world are boiling deserts, scorched by a sun from which the only respite is the nightly eclipse of a vast silver moon. A great ring of ice encircles the equator, which knows only two distant stars, one of which always hangs in the sky.

More gold and jewels and magic lost to man have fallen between the cracks in the world than you can imagine. Who better to retrieve it than a band of stalwart heroes? You and your friends *are* those heroes. You go where others can't or won't. There are monstrous things lurking in Arden. Are you ready to face them?

## The Players
Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the party to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring adventurer, who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. **This is the players' core responsibility:** they engage with the premise of the game, seeking out interesting opportunities for adventure in Arden, taking big risks against powerful foes and sending their characters into danger.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM. For more, see **Players Best Practices**.

## The Characters
The adventurers attempt to develop their party from a ragtag group of poor independents to a serious and reputed heroes who have built a name for themselves, leaving their own unique mark on the world in the process. They do this by taking risky jobs, planning their own escapades, forging alliances and outsmarting their enemies. They'll gain the respect of the factions they help, and suffer the ire of the factions they get in the way of.

There are several character types to choose from:

* **Artificers** are tinkerers, alchemists and saboteurs.
* **Bards** are manipulators and spies.
* **Disciples** are mortals touched by the gods.
* **Mages** are arcane adepts.
* **Rangers** are deadly sharpshooters and trackers.
* **Rogues** are stealthy infiltrators.
* **Shamans** are spirit guides and druids. 
* **Warriors** are dangerous and intimidating fighters.

Character types aren't unique. You can mix and match, or play a party that is all of one type. It's up to you. For more, see **Character Creation**.

## The Party
In addition to creating adventurer characters, you'll also create the party by choosing which type of quests you're interested in exploring. The party gets its own "character sheet", just like a player character.

* A **Cult** serves a higher power.
* **Defenders** protect a community or people.
* **Explorers** adventure to satisfy their curiosity.
* **Rebels** plot to overthrow an oppressor.
* **Slayers** are monster hunters for hire.
* **Villains** are evildoers with nefarious ends.

The party type isn't restrictive (you can pursue a variety of activities); it’s there to help focus the gameplay.

## The Game Master
The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.

The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so that it's pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn't in charge of the story and doesn't have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead. For more, see **Running the Game**.

## Playing A Session
So, what’s it like to play? A session of *Heroes in the Storm* is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus maybe some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.

During a session, the party of adventurers works together to choose a quest to accomplish (either by getting a job from an NPC or by creating their own goal), then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the quest in progress. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the quest (succeed or fail). Then the party has downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and indulge their vices. After downtime, the players once again look for a new opportunity or create their own goals and pursuits, and we play to find out what happens next.

A given game session is typically one quest and the following downtime, plus exploration and discovery of a new opportunity. As your group gets more familiar with the game, you might be able to pack more into a session, even doing two quests in an evening of play.
After a dozen sessions or so, you might decide to have a break in the flow of the story and start up a “season two” series, possibly with a slightly different cast of characters and a new starting situation.

## Before You Start
Read this book once through. You won’t immediately understand everything until you see it play. You won’t get all the rules right the first time. That’s fine; the rules will make more sense when you read them again after you play. The system of *Heroes in the Storm* is designed to be learned as an ongoing process. Each time you play you’ll get better, until everything is second nature.

You might be the only person in the game group that’s read the book. That’s fine, too, but then it’s on you to convey everything to the other players, so that's a job that you're taking on.

What the other players will need to do, though, is buy into the *idea* of the game. Tell them it’s a game about daring adventurers in a magical fantasy world city. Mention a few **Touchstones** that they're familiar with (see the list below). If their eyes haven't lit up yet, maybe this game isn't going to click with them. That’s fine. You can always play a different game with that person some other time. You want to have full buy-in from your players.

Read through the **Starting Situation** again and get a good handle on the important factions involved, what they want, who runs them. Or, feel free to make up your own starting situation. Just enough to throw the group into an interesting circumstance right out of the gate. You don't want everyone sitting there, excited to play, and then say, “So... what do you want to do first?” The starting situation keeps the momentum high at the beginning.

For more, see **Starting the Game**.

## Touchstones
When you're pitching the game to prospective players, here are some media touchstones you can use to relate the game to stuff with which they're already familiar.

### TV

* **The Witcher** by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich et al.

### Books
* **Elric of Melniboné** by Michael Moorcock.
* **A Song of Ice and Fire** by George R. R. Martin
* **The Hobbit** and **The Lord of the Rings** by J.R.R. Tolkien.
* **The Odyssey** by Homer.
* **The Witcher** by Andrzej Sapkowski.

### Games
* **Dungeons and Dragons** by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.
* The **Elder Scrolls** series by Bethesda Game Studios.

### Films

## What You Need To Play
* Two to four players and one game master.
* A handful of six-sided dice (at least six).
* Printed copies of the character playbooks, party sheets, and reference sheets + maps.
* This book, for reference.
* Blank paper, index cards, pencils and markers for notes and sketches.

## Making The Game Your Own
This game is about exciting adventures with adventurers in a fantasy world. Before you get too far into actually playing the game, you should have a talk with your table about what sort of themes you’d like to see in play. Not every game is for every group of players, and you need your potential party to buy into the conceit of the game.

Some of this is indirectly decided by what sorts of characters you make and what type of party you select. For example, if you want
themes of revolution, choose to play as rebels. However, you should be talking through your decisions so that everyone is on the same page about what you're trying to do. If someone is uncomfortable with a direction, negotiate with each other to ensure everyone has fun.

This book is a distillation of best practices and useful elements. It’s one leg of the tripod that forms the basis for successful play: The book, your group, and the online community. Roleplaying is, at its essence, an expressive act. Everything in this book exists to help you and your friends express yourselves by creating collaborative social fiction about a party of daring adventurers. You have interesting things to say, and it’s my job to inspire you and maybe also point out a few interesting things I’ve come up with, too. But it's not my job to tell you exactly what to say about everything.
